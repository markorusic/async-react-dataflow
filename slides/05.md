# The best way of dealing with async data atm ðŸŽ‰

`useAsync` is nice, but it does not provide in-memory caching of resolved data, easy way of refetching or optimistic updates.

`react-query` is library which provides all of that, and much more, and it's the best way of handling async stuff at the moment.
